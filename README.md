# Lugx - Game Selling Website

A game selling website like [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) built with **Laravel** and **Lugx template**. This is the best place where we can buy or sell games.
Some important functions I got here: 

- User functions (login, logout, change name, ...)
- **Sell** and **Buy** games
- Comment, search games with filter
- Co-op with many other companies
- Sale games if you are the owner
- **Give** or **Receive** games
